<h2>What Youth Day means for South Africa:</h2>
     <p>Youth Day is a very important for all of us South Africans. <br>
        It is a day where we as South Africans honour the youths of <br> 
        1976 who were ambushed by the apartheid regime police during <br>
        their peaceful protest in Soweto, where approximately 500 students <br>
        were killed.

       the law which had introduced Afrikaans as the medium 
       of instruction in black township schools.

    <h2>Involvement of the police:</h2>
         <p>When the police were called in to disperse the crowd, the peaceful protest took a turn for the worst.
            When the police arrived at the scene of the protest, they arrived with dogs and weapons and started
            by using tear gas oninnocent students and youths. And when the youths started fighting back,
             bullets started flying all over the scene as a means to try and control
            the students as they were fighting back.

         <h2>The heroes who lost their lives:</h2>
         <p> On the final image is an image of three students who were part of the protest, one of which is Hector Pieterson, a 12-year old boy, carried by a 15-year
            old Hastings Ndlovu who was hurt during the protest. In this picture Ndlovu is seen carrying Pieterson to a place of safety after being injured due to the police. It is one
            of the many pictures that symbolise the importance of youth day in South Africa.
